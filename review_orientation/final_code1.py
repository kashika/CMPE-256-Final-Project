#review="Food is good, but I am giving a one star review for the hostess on duty on 7/3/2015 at ~11:40 am. We have 3 adults, 3 kids between 7-10, and one 2 yrs old baby in stroller arriving the entrance, the restaurant was about 1/5 packed, I asked do you have seat for 7 ?, she answered me right away No we dont even without turning her head over to take a look at the seating area.  I was surprised and shocked at that time, because it was obvious that there were plenty of seatings available.   I stood there until a waiter came to me and greeted us to the seats.  Well, we enjoyed the food here, yet do not appreciate the attitude of the hostess, when we walked out she didn't even look at us, let alone giving us the thank you good bye that I expect to receive from most of restaurants."

Keyboard back light is amazing. Your batter gonna perform awesome for a year may be ( depends on usage - i used to write code and graphic processing. Cons- Worst screen -- It feels like i'm looking at 1997 tv screens after 3-4 months later i can clearly see screen blinks red and white lines going up and down - twice i have changed screen - screen cost around 5k to 6k .Heating issues. The palm rest around touch pad catches durt so quickly so quickly that u have to keep a cloth with u all the time. Over all Build quality is sooo poor .. really buy acer or asus or macbook their build quality is just amazing."
